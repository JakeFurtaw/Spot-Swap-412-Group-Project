What is TU Spot Swap?
------------------------------------------------------------------
This app is designed to make parking in the glenn garage a breeze. It will give users the ability to communicate with each other in a social media 
like environment to figure out when spots are free or going to be free, where they are located(level), which kind of spot they are(core,staff, visitor, etc.), and the most efficent route to take to get there.

Users will create and account on the app, communicate within the app to swap spots, and rate/tip the person if they held the spot they promised you.
